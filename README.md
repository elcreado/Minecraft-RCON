## About <a name = "about"></a>

**StreamCraft Rewards** is an open-source tool designed to enhance live streaming experiences by enabling real-time interaction between streamers and their viewers. It integrates with Twitch channel points and TikTok donations to trigger in-game rewards in Minecraft, such as items, commands, or custom events.

This project is currently in **beta**, supporting TikTok donation presets. Future updates will expand functionality, improve user customization, and add support for additional platforms and reward types to deliver an even better streaming experience.
